# Welcome to Gudni

Gudni is a fast 2d rasterizer built specifically for the Haskell ecosystem.

It is named for the late Icelandic painter Georg Gu√∞ni Hauksson.

Here are some of the features of the system:

* GPU accelerated rasterization.
* High quality anti-aliasing of objects with large amount of subpixel detail.
* Stochastic anti-aliasing (experimental) is an attempt to add a random factor to mask spatial aliasing and "naturalize" an image.
* Support for transparency.
* Support for additive and subtractive shape geometry on the fly.
* Rudimentary image texturing support.

The goal is to create an engine that can create a realtime output for figures with the complexity of a normal interface (~10,000 shapes) and slower but perfect outputs for highly complex images  with the complexity of artwork. (1M+ shapes). Getting there will require moving more of the current shape pipeline onto the GPU, which is in the roadmap.

## Code Guide

The purpose of this library is to convert a vector description of a figure to a raster image. Because Gudni uses a GPU via OpenCL for part of this computation the library must just-in-time compiles its OpenCL kernels prior doing any work and must interact with the GPU inside of an IO and CLState monad. Unfortunately because of this there is no way to use the rasterizer as a pure function. To abstract the details of this interaction away from someone using the library we use a callback style API. Users initially call the function runApplication and pass that function a data structure which represents the state of their application and is an instance of typeclass Model. The typeclass defines functions which can modify this state and provide the rasterizer with information based on the state, including a constructScene which provides the rasterizer with all of the vector geometry and metadata that describes an individual image. The specifics of these functions are illustrated in the following examples.

### Example 1: Simple Square.
The file examples/Square.hs provides the minimal demonstration of the library API. The program defines a datatype SquareState which happens to contain values for the scale and rotation of a square.
We declare SquareState to be an instance of typeclass Model.



updateModel -- takes the current elapsed time and a list of inputs and produces an updated state.

constructFigure -- takes the current state (and a status string) and constructs a ShapeTreeRoot which defines a
frame of figures to be rasterized.

A ShapeTree is an STree of STree, the outer tree defining each individually textured shape and the inner tree defining shapes
that share the same texture and are added or subtracted from one another. ShapeTrees also contain transform nodes
that apply transformations to their child nodes. The file /Util/Draw.hs has many combinators for creating ShapeTrees.

The folder benchmarks contains two programs that use gudni as a library.
GudniBenchmarks.hs has a series of drawings designed to test performance and find bugs. Run this with

cabal new-run gudni-benchmarks

keyboard responds to: "a", "w", "s", "d" translate drawing, "r", "t" rotate, "[" "]" scale, left arrow, right arrow, select drawing, spacebar run/pause animation

GudniTraceVisualizer can read an output extracted from the opencl kernel and draw a diagram of the trace. I've been using this to find edge cases. (Currently broken. )

cabal new-run gudni-trace-visualizer


The source folders are organized as such:

* /Figure -- source related to drawing shapes
* /Interface -- source related to interacting with SDL2 or other frontend libraries.
* /OpenCL -- source related to GPU specific code.
* /Raster -- source related to prepping shapes to be rasterized on the gpu kernel.
* /Util -- other stuff

## Build Notes

Modifying OpenCL Kernels:

Kernels.cl currently includes all opencl code. This is referenced by the EmbeddedOpenCLSource.hs
On some build systems changing to Kernels.cl won't trigger a recompile of EmbeddedOpenCLSource
so a small change to EmbeddedOpenCLSource (such as adding whitespace) is needed to get the new OpenCL code changes to be embedded.

CLUtil:

I'm using the most recent version of CLUtil from github https://github.com/acowley/CLUtil

OpenCL library:

To get it to compile on MacOSX Sierra I changed the following in my local OpenCL.cabal file:

```
  if os(darwin)
    cpp-options: -DCALLCONV=ccall -D__nullable= -DGL_SILENCE_DEPRECATION
    cc-options: "-U__BLOCKS__"
    Frameworks:  OpenCL
```
