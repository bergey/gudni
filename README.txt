Gudni is a fast 2d rasterizer built with the Haskell community in mind.

It is named for the late Icelandic painter Georg Gu√∞ni Hauksson.

Here are some of the features of the system:

-- GPU accelerated rasterization.
-- High quality anti-aliasing of objects with large amount of subpixel detail.
-- Support for transparency.
-- Support for additive and subtractive shape geometry.
-- Rudimentary image texturing support.

The goal is to create an engine that can create a realtime output for figures with the complexity of a normal interface and slower but perfect
outputs for highly complex images with the complexity of artwork.

Code Guide:

The users of the library create an instance of the typeclass Model for the state of their application.
The typeclass has two main member functions updateModel and constructFigure

updateModel -- takes the current elapsed time and a list of inputs and produces an updated state.

constructFigure -- takes the current state (and a status string) and constructs a ShapeTreeRoot which defines a
frame of figures to be rasterized.

A ShapeTree is an STree of STree, the outer tree defining each individually textured shape and the inner tree defining shapes
that share the same texture and are added or subtracted from one another. ShapeTrees also contain transform nodes
that apply transformations to their child nodes. The file /Util/Draw.hs has many combinators for creating ShapeTrees.

The folder benchmarks contains two programs that use gudni as a library.
GudniBenchmarks.hs has a series of drawings designed to test performance and find bugs. Run this with

cabal new-run gudni-benchmarks

keyboard responds to: "a", "w", "s", "d" translate drawing, "r", "t" rotate, "[" "]" scale, left arrow, right arrow, select drawing, spacebar run/pause animation

GudniTraceVisualizer can read an output extracted from the opencl kernel and draw a diagram of the trace. I've been using this to find edge cases. (Currently broken. )

cabal new-run gudni-trace-visualizer


The source folders are organized as such:

/Figure -- source related to drawing shapes
/Interface -- source related to interacting with SDL2 or other frontend libraries.
/OpenCL -- source related to GPU specific code.
/Raster -- source related to prepping shapes to be rasterized on the gpu kernel.
/Util -- other stuff

Build Notes:

Modifying OpenCL Kernels:

Kernels.cl currently includes all opencl code. This is referenced by the EmbeddedOpenCLSource.hs
On some build systems changing to Kernels.cl won't trigger a recompile of EmbeddedOpenCLSource
so a small change to EmbeddedOpenCLSource (such as adding whitespace) is needed to get the new OpenCL code changes to be embedded.

CLUtil:

I'm using the most recent version of CLUtil from github https://github.com/acowley/CLUtil

OpenCL library:

To get it to compile on MacOSX Sierra I changed the following in my local OpenCL.cabal file:

  if os(darwin)
    cpp-options: -DCALLCONV=ccall -D__nullable= -DGL_SILENCE_DEPRECATION
    cc-options: "-U__BLOCKS__"
    Frameworks:  OpenCL
